## PayPal Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results

## PayPal delivered solid fourth quarter and 2024 results; begins 2025 with strong foundation for continued transformation and new $\$ 15$ billion share repurchase authorization

SAN JOSE, Calif., (February 4, 2025) - PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024.
"PayPal had a strong finish to a successful 2024 with results that were better than we expected. We set out at the beginning of 2024 to narrow our focus, improve execution, and reposition the business. One year later, I'm proud that we've laid a strong foundation for long-term, profitable growth across the company's most important areas. The improvements we made to branded checkout, peer-topeer, and Venmo, plus the progress we made on our price-to-value strategy, are beginning to show up in our results.

The strong momentum we've created sets us up well for 2025, which is about scaling adoption. I'm excited to share more at our Investor Day later this month."

Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:

- Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the Total Payment Volume ("TPV") completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.
- Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our consumers and merchants. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.

Amounts in the table are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.
${ }^{(1)}$ An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's platform or services through such third-party's login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet's payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.
${ }^{(2)}$ Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
${ }^{(3)}$ Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.
${ }^{(4)}$ TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
${ }^{(5)}$ Transaction expense rate is transaction expense divided by TPV.
${ }^{(6)}$ Transaction and credit loss rate is transaction and credit losses divided by TPV.
${ }^{(7)}$ Transaction margin is net revenues less transaction expense and transaction and credit losses, divided by net revenues.# PayPal Holdings, Inc. <br> Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance 

To supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow.

These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should be used to evaluate the company's results of operations only in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
Reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the subsequent tables included in this press release.
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of nonGAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.
For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, restructuring-related charges, certain other gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results, and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.
The company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, nonGAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP effective tax rate:

Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.
Restructuring. These consist of expenses related to workforce reduction and include employee severance and benefits costs, real estate and facilities charges, stock-based compensation expense, and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.
Gains and losses on strategic investments. The gains and losses we record on our strategic investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in. We exclude such gains and losses in full because the operations of the investee and the related gains and losses are not indicative of our ongoing operating results.
Certain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions that have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of our current or ongoing operating results.
Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.
Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company uses free cash flow as a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.
In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also analyzes certain measures, including net revenues and operating expenses, on an FX-neutral basis to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. The company believes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not indicative of the company's operations and evaluating growth in net revenues and operating expenses on an FX-neutral basis provides an additional meaningful and comparable assessment of these measures to both management and investors. FX-neutral results are calculated by translating the current period's local currency results with the prior period's exchange rate. FX-neutral growth rates are calculated by comparing the current period's FX-neutral results by the prior period's results, excluding the impact from hedging activities.PayPal Holdings, Inc.
