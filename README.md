# FundamentalStocks
This project is about automating my manual EXCEL and data research based fundamental stock valuation for stock picking of value and growth stocks. For this I use the FinancialModelingPrep-API, a PostgreSQL database and an AI system based on a LLM by MistralAI.

The project is ongoing, therefore only a short outlook on the roadmap.

## Roadmap

#### Step 1: Create project and setup Postgres ✅
- Postgres successfully installed on local machine
- PW is stored in system variable
- Basic functions and table creation SQL-code written in Python

#### Step 2: Fill initial Databases ✅
- Databases for stock, company_info, stock-prices and outstanding_shares created and filled via FMP-API
- INSERT and UPDATE commands with foreign key created in Python
- First tests created

#### Step 3: Notebook SQL Analysis
- Advanced analytical SQL commands on existing basic SQL datasets with JOINS, GROUPBY and WINDWO Function in Jupyter notebook
- Exercice only!

#### Step 4: Get Income, Balance and Cashflow Data
